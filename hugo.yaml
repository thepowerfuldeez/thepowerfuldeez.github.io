    Previously I worked at Together AI running distributed training on
    hundreds of GPUs and building evals. At Snap I developed multimodal LLMs
    that reached 100M+ users, did diffusion model pre-training, built AI
    applications end-to-end, and contributed to research. I work across text,
    image, and speech.

      Currently: exploring pre‑training LLM training efficiency, sample
      efficiency, building small coding LLMs, and finance LLM agents.

      Previously I worked at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) running
      distributed training on hundreds of GPUs and building evals. At
      [Snap](https://snap.com/) I developed multimodal LLMs that reached 100M+
      users, did diffusion model pre-training, built AI applications
      end-to-end, and contributed to research. I work across text, image, and
      speech.

      ### Highlights
      - Large-scale fine-tuning and evaluation of open-source LLMs (1B–405B),
        with a focus on training efficiency and model quality.
      - Built distributed training platforms (60+ LLMs, 600+ GPUs) and
        LLM-as-a-judge evaluation pipelines (Flyte-orchestrated).
      - Long-context fine-tuning: custom sequence parallelism with
        `flash_attn_varlen` for 131k-context (LLaMA 3.1 70B) and 16k-context
        (LLaMA 3.1 405B).
